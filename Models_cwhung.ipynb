    "# Try to model the result of a coin toss. In your model, include any features that you think important in explaining the result. Discuss with your mentor about the pros and cons of adding too many features into your model.\n",
    "The features for coin toss can be 1) tossed by right/left hand, 2) coin landed on material: concrete/carpet/hardwood floor, 3) coin used: penny/nickel/quarter, 4) room temperature, 5) humidity, 6) date and time, etc.  Adding too many will make the model too complex to analyze.  However if we pick too less features, we may lose the one that really matters.  "
